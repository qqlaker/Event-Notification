# ðŸ“¢Event Notification System

âš  *The current version is a prototype and is not intended for real use. The latest release is paid and protected by consumer rights* âš  <br/>

â–· **The main goal of the project:** <br/>
receive and process information about various events (concerts, movies, performances, etc.)

---
### â˜° The project consists of two parts:
- Ticketmaster API parser [[tm]](https://github.com/qqlaker/Ticket-Notification/tree/main/tm )
- Twitter (X) API parser [[tw]](https://github.com/qqlaker/Ticket-Notification/tree/main/tw )

Both parts are managed from a file [server.py](https://github.com/qqlaker/Ticket-Notification/blob/main/server.py) <br/>
This approach ensures fault tolerance of the system <br/>

Both scenarios receive filtered data from the official API and send it to the Discord server, previously divided into categories
